;; Note that this file is half-baked: it's enough for `guix shell`,
;; but it's not detailed enough to build/install the package using Guix.

;; To enter a shell with the necessary dependencies for development:
;;   guix shell
;;
;; To build and install:
;;   guix package -f guix.scm
;;
;; To build it, but not install it:
;;   guix build -f guix.scm
